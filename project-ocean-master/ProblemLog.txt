Current VWorld Issues:

1. Octopi execute NOT_FULL animations properly, but freeze when they contact become full (eat two fish)
2. Fish do not turn into crabs when left alone
3. Entity.transformNotFull runs to completion and returns "true"
4. Fixed octo transform logic.  Added 1st parameter "entity" to Entity.scheduleActions
5. Fixed crab creation issues.
6. Fixed Atlantis party issue.
7. Only issue left is that the grass leaves a gray spot when destroyed by a crab
8. Fixed issue 7 by fixing logic in "executeQuakeActivity"

PROJECT 1 COMPLETE!!!
